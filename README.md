## 💡 Selected Projects

Here are a few recent projects I’ve worked on:

- 🧠 [**Brain Age Prediction from MRI Features**](https://github.com/szekerbalazs/szekerbalazs/blob/main/BrainAgePrediction/BrainAgePrediction.ipynb)  
  Developed a regression model to estimate brain age from MRI-derived features.  
  📈 *Ranked 13th out of 150 teams in a Kaggle competition.*

- 🫀 [**Heart Rhythm Classification from ECG Data**](https://github.com/szekerbalazs/szekerbalazs/blob/main/ECGAnalysis/ECGAnalysis.py)  
  Built a CNN based classifier for identifying heart rhythm anomalies from ECG signals.  
  📈 *Achieved 14th place out of 131 participants in a Kaggle challenge.*

- ☀️ **Modeling the Temporal Evolution of Roof Reflectivity**  
  Applied time series models and Gaussian Process Regression to forecast changes in rooftop solar reflectivity.

- ❓ **Sentiment Analysis with Fine-Tuned BERT**  
  Fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment classification tasks on domain-specific text data.

- 🖼️ **Contrastive Learning for Image Analysis**  
  Explored self-supervised contrastive learning methods for image representation learning.

- 🖼️ **Image Classification with SWAG**  
  Implemented classification models incorporating the SWAG (Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian) method to improve generalization.
