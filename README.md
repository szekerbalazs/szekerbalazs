## 👋 Hi, I’m Balu

I am a Master's Student in Statistics at ETH with a strong focus on Machine Learning and AI.

Here are a few selected projects I have worked on recently:
- 🧠 [Brain Age Prediction from MRI Features](https://github.com/szekerbalazs/szekerbalazs/blob/main/BrainAgePrediction/BrainAgePrediction.ipynb) (Ranked 13/150 in Kaggle Competition)
- 🫀 [Heart Rhythm Classification from ECG Data](https://github.com/szekerbalazs/szekerbalazs/blob/main/ECGAnalysis/ECGAnalysis.py) (Ranked 14/131 in Kaggle Competition)
- ☀️ Modelling Time Evolution of Solar Reflectivity of Roofs with Time Series Modelling and Gaussian Process Regression for Hyperparameters
- ❓ Sentiment Analysis with finetuning a BERT Model
- 🖼️ Contrastive Learning in Image Analysis
- 🖼️ Image Classification with SWAG

You can find a selection of these projects in this repo here :)
